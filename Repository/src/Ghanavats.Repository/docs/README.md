# Ghanavats Repository Pattern NuGet Package
Ready-to-Use Repository Implementations with EF Core.

## Overview
The Ghanavats.Repository NuGet package builds upon the flexible foundation 
provided by Ghanavats.Repository.Abstractions, 
delivering concrete repository implementations powered by Entity Framework Core. 

This package streamlines data access for EF Core-based applications, 
allowing developers to focus on business logic while leveraging robust, pre-built repository patterns. 
Perfect for projects that need a reliable, out-of-the-box data access solution.

## Future Plans
Expanding Horizons: MongoDB Support Coming Soon

In the next phase of development, Ghanavats.Repository will extend its support to include MongoDB.

This addition will provide developers with greater flexibility, 
enabling seamless integration with NoSQL databases while maintaining the same consistent interface design.
